The Bernouilli Process-



Options Greeks:

Why buy options? 
	Speculation - mininal commitment and only need to pay a premium. Calls
	Hedging - reduces risk at a reasonable cost. Puts
	Spreading - use of two or more options positions
	Synthetics - Avoid legal or regulatory reason for owning it. Allow one to gain without "actually" owning the stock

Four Cardinal Coordinates: Holder - people who buy option, Writer - peopel who options 
	1. Buy Calls - has the right to buy at a certain prices - don't mean they will, they just have the rights, but they will loss their premium of their options
	2. Sell Calls - are obligated to sell - have unlimited risk and can lose much more than the price of the options premium
	3. Buy Puts - has the right to sell at a certain prices - don't mean they will, they just have the rights, but they will loss their premium of their options
	4. Sell Puts - are obligated to buy - have unlimited risk and can lose much more than the price of the options premium

Premium is determined by factors including the stock price, strike price, time remaining until expiration and volatility
for call options: 
In the money if the share price is above the strike price
out of the money if the share price is below the strike price


What is the Greeks in Options?
	1. Delta - measures the sensitvity of an option's value to a price change in the underlying asset.
		Call Option + Put Options -
	2. Gamma - measures the rate of change in delta for each one-point increase in the underlying asset
	3. Theta - The dollar amount an option loses with each day that passes
		Increase near expiration, decrease in and out of the money options
	4. Vega - meausres an option's sensitvity to changes in Volatility.
		Increase if volativility increase 
They all measure the sensentive of price
