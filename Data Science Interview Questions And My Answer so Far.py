1. Compare Data Science Vs. Machine Learning
Data Science - Multidisciplinary, Lossely Integrated, and can take on a business role
Machine Learning - Training Machines to predict or charactersics, tightly integrated, and purely technical role

2. What is Data Science?
Data Science is a blend of Statistics, technical skills and business vision which is used to analyze the available data and predict the future trend.

3. How is it different from big data and data analytics?
big data - huge volumes of data-structured, unstructured and semi-structured and requires a basic knowledge of statistics and mathematics
data science - deals with slicing and dicing the data, requires in depth knowledge of statistics and mathematics
data analytics - contributing operational insights into complex business scenarios - require moderate amount of statistics and mathematics

4. Compare SAS, R and Python programming
SAS - most widely used analytics tools - some of the best statistical functions, graphical user interface, but has a price tag and not easily adopted by smaller enterprises
R - a Open source tool use generously by academia and research community. It is a robust tool for statistical computation, graphical representation and reporting. Open Source Nature
Python - Power open source programming language and east to learn, work well. Innumerable libraries and community created modules. Very robust

5. Various benefits of R language?
A extensive collection of tools for data analysis
Operators for performing calculations on matrix and array
Data analysis technique for graphical representation
Simple and effective language
Support ML applications
Database and various of dataset supports
Robust package ecosystem
Solve data-oriented problem

Need to learn basic R

6. WHat are the two main components of the Hadoop Framework?
HDFS - Hadoop Distrubted File System - a distributed database working on top of Hadoop. Storing and retrieving bulk of datasets in no time
YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator - It allocates resources dynamically and handles the workloads.

7. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis
Univariate - one variable and no relationship causes. _ summarize the data and find patterns within it to make actionable decisions
Bivariate - two variable - chi-squared tests and t-tests to see if they are a correlations
Multivariate - three or more - find the correlations between each variables and their potential causes and patterns

8. Power analysis
Power analysis lets you understand the sample size estimate so that they are neither high or low. Kets you determine the sample size needed for detecting an effect of a given size
 from a cuase with a certain degree of assurance

9. What are the different variable reduction techniques you know of?
Information Value Criteria
Clustering
Principal components
Factor analysis

10. WHat is the difference between parametric models and non parametric models?
The data is assumed to follow some theoretical distribution in parametric model - normal or binomial distribution
Non Parametric models does not assume any theoretical distribution of the data - smoothing models

11. Correclation vs regression
correclation - two way phenomenon, where regression is one way


12. Systematic sample vs opportunity sample vs stratified sample vs cluster sample
SS - every other n one
OS - all within a certain group
Stratified Sample - divide by homogeniues group
Cluster sample - break things up into groups - that has different charactersics
