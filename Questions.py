3. Pairs with Specific Difference: Given an array arr of distinct integers and a nonnegative integer k, write a function findPairsWithGivenDifference that returns an array of all pairs [x,y] in arr, such that x - y = k. If no such pairs exist, return an empty array.
input:  arr = [0, -1, -2, 2, 1], k = 1
output: [[0, -1], [-1, -2], [2, 1], [1, 0]]

output: []
