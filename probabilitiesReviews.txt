1. A jar contains four marbles: three red, one whit e. Two marbles are drawn w ith replacement
List a sample space containing four outcomes:
{RR, RW, WR,WW}  9/16 3/16 3/16 1/16

2. We are playing w ith a short deck, as shown at right . Let "H" be the event t he card drawn is a heart. 2Ì 2Ë 2Ê 2Í
Let " D" be the event the card drawn is a diamond. Let "A" be the event the card is an ace.

Are H and D independent events? No,  they are mutually exclusive. If one occurs, the other cannot!
Are H and A independent events? Yes, they are independent. Each of this even can occurs at draw.

Conditional Probabilities - The probably of the next event change given the previous event


3. If P(A) = ½ and P(B) = ½ and P(B|A) = 1/3 , find:
P(A and B) =  P(A) P(B| A) = (½ ) (a) = 1/6
P(A or B) =  P(A ) + P(B) – P(A an d B) = ½ + ½ – 1/ 6 = 5/ 6
P(A| B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

4. It is dif fic ult to calcu late d irect ly t he ch ance o f at least t w o m atc hing b irth days, becau se you have to allow for

two birthday
365/365*(364/365)*....*336/365 = over 70% atleast two birthdays match
three birthday = P(None) - P(2 sharing birthday) * (The number of different way to share 2 birthday)

The number of different way to share 2 birthday = 24!/(2! *(22!)) = C(24 2) = 276

p(None) = P(365, 24)/365^24
p(1) = 276 * P(365 23)
1 - P(none) - P(1) = 0.16578

5. A 1-inch-diameter coin is thrown on a table covered wit h a grid of lines tw o inches apart.
What is the probability t he coin lands in a square without touching any of the lines of t he grid?
The area of the whole square is 2 x 2 = 4
When the centre of the coin is in the small square,the coin touches only one colour
The area of the small square is 1, because the side is 1.
So the shaded area is 4 - 1 = 3.
The chance of touching two colours is therefore 3/4 or 75 per cent.
